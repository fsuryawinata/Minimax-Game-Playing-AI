# Inflexion AI Project

This project involves developing an AI for the game Inflexion as part of a university assignment. The AI utilizes the minimax algorithm and incorporates TDLeaf techniques to improve its gameplay performance.

## Overview

The goal of the project is to implement an AI capable of playing Inflexion effectively against other agents or players. The AI evaluates game states using minimax with alpha-beta pruning for decision-making and integrates TDLeaf for enhanced heuristic evaluation.

### Running the AI

To run the AI, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python -m referee <player1> <player2>
